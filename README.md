# Go Hexagonal API

This project is a study case to configure an hexagonal (clean architecture) with go.

To exercise this project we are going to implement a classic TODO app.


## TODO API app

We are creating a TODO API app that can:

- INSERT a new TODO item
- LIST my TODO items
- DELETE one TODO item
